PAGE command removed - replaced by GUI PAGE
GUI TEXTBOX ACTIVATE removed
Reduced available RAM and program size from 120KB to 116KB
Removes support for the GDEH029A1 display as this controller is now obsolete

Breaking changes PicoMiteVGA
Reduced available RAM and program size from 108KB to 100KB

General changes - both versions
Various tuning and performance improvements
Updates SDK to V1.4
Updates Compiler to version 11.2.1
Enables operation up to 378MHz
SETPIN for PWM no longer needs to specify the channel and port e.g. "SETPIN 1,PWM" is now accepted
Re-engineering of PORT command to allow simultaneous update
Modifies the port function to read all pins simultaneously
Revised version of CSub header to cater for compiler change
Updated CSUB header file and additional functions exposed
The number of flash slots in both versions is now 5
